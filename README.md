# Blocklists and Whitelists for AdGuard Home (Personalized)

This repository contains personalized blocklists and whitelists designed for my personal use with AdGuard Home.

## Purpose and Disclaimer

The primary goal of this repository is to host filtering lists that I have created and maintained for my own environment. **It is important to note that these lists are tailored to my specific needs and preferences and may not be suitable for general use.**

Due to their personalized nature, the lists contained here:

* May not be exhaustive or complete.
* May contain very specific blocks or exceptions.
* Are not designed to provide a robust and universal filtering solution.

While these lists may be useful to other users, **it is strongly recommended to review and adjust them to fit your own needs.** I am not responsible for the content or effectiveness of these lists in other environments.

The lists included here are intended to:

* Block annoying ads and trackers (according to my preferences).
* Block malicious and phishing websites (to the best of my research).
* Allow access to specific websites and services (that I use).
* Block inappropriate or harmful content (according to my criteria).

## Usage with AdGuard Home

To use these lists in your AdGuard Home, follow these steps:
